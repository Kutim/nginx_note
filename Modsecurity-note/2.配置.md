- File Uploads
	```
	# The location where ModSecurity will store intercepted
	# uploaded files. This location must be private to ModSecurity.
	SecUploadDir /opt/modsecurity/var/upload/

	# By default, do not intercept (nor store) uploaded files.
	SecUploadKeepFiles Off

	# Uploaded files are by default created with permissions that
	# do not allow any other user to access them. You may need to
	# relax that if you want to interface ModSecurity to an
	# external program (e.g., an anti-virus).
	SecUploadFileMode 0600
	```

- Debug Log
	```
	# Debug log
	SecDebugLog /opt/modsecurity/var/log/debug.log
	SecDebugLogLevel 3
	```
- Audit Log
	```
	# Log only what is really necessary. 
	# Other possible values for SecAuditEngine are On (log everything) and Off (log nothing).
	SecAuditEngine RelevantOnly

	# Also log requests that cause a server error.
	SecAuditLogRelevantStatus ^5

	# Log everything we know about a transaction.
	SecAuditLogParts ABCDEFHKZ

	# Use a single file for logging.
	SecAuditLogType Serial
	SecAuditLog /opt/modsecurity/var/log/audit.log

	# Specify the path for concurrent audit logging.
	SecAuditLogStorageDir /opt/modsecurity/var/audit/

	```
	SecArgumentSeparator &
	SecCookieFormat 0

- 默认的规则匹配策略
	```
	SecDefaultAction "phase:1,log,auditlog,pass"
	```
- 处理解析错误
	```
	# Verify that we've correctly processed the request body.
	# As a rule of thumb, when failing to process a request body
	# you should reject the request (when deployed in blocking mode)
	# or log a high-severity alert (when deployed in detection-only mode).
	SecRule REQBODY_PROCESSOR_ERROR "!@eq 0" \
		"phase:2,t:none,log,block,msg:'Failed to parse request body: …
	%{REQBODY_PROCESSOR_ERROR_MSG}'"

	# By default be strict with what we accept in the multipart/form-data
	# request body. If the rule below proves to be too strict for your
	# environment consider changing it to detection-only. You are encouraged
	# _not_ to remove it altogether.
	SecRule MULTIPART_STRICT_ERROR "!@eq 0" \
	"phase:2,t:none,log,block,msg:'Multipart request body \
